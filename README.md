## Parser
Markdown is an efficient way to take notes because it allows the user to write text without HTML tags.
I built a parser in Python to generate HTML files from the markdown files. The parser ensures the HTML files
have the same HTML structure as the home page to provide consistent structure and styling across the site.

## Run parser
Run `python3 markdown-parser.py` to generate the HTML file.
