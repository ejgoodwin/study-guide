# Study Guide

A guide to keep track of study topics for development. The guide includes my notes and external resources.

## Parser
Markdown is an efficient way to take notes. It allows text to be written without the need for html tags.
I built a parser in Python to generate HTML files from the markdown files. The parser ensures the HTML files
have the same HTML structure as the home page to provide consistent structure and styling across the site.

## Run parser
When a new markdown file is created, run `python3 markdown-parser.py` to generate the HTML file.
